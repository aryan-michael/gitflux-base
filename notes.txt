3 scripts needed:
  - installation script (install.sh)
  - uninstallation script (uninstall.sh)
  - binary (gitflux.sh)

---

All the scripts need to be added to PATH so as to be accessed globally.
The binary script needs to be symlinked.
 - the application should be run by `gitflux` and not `./gitflux.sh`.

SSH Authentication Key generation and setup process:

--> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "git_email" -f ~/.ssh/git_username
# Generates an ssh key pair with 
- type (-t) eg. ed25519, rsa -b 4096. 
- creates file (-f) and names the key {git_username} and automatically creates public key {git_username.pub}

--> passphrases aren't important for SSH keys

--> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# Starts your SSH Agent (if not running already)

--> ssh-add ~/.ssh/git_username
# Adds your private key to the SSH Agent

--> cat ~/.ssh/git_username.pub
# Outputs your public key.
- Copy the outputted key and paste it in the designated section on the GitHub website. Assign a name to it for reference.

--> ssh -T git@github.com
# Verifies your SSH connection
